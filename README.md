# shadowstream-v2
A clean re-architecture of Shadowstream with a fully containerized Postgres workflow. This version focuses on correctness, clarity, and maintainability, built as a fresh playground for exploring better data models, cleaner Go service structure, and improved development ergonomics using Docker-based infrastructure.
